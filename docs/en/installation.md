# Installation

```
composer require jonom/focuspoint
```

See the [packagist listing](https://packagist.org/packages/jonom/focuspoint) and [installation instructions](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/getting_started/composer/#adding-modules-to-your-project)

## Hydration task

For optimal performance, run the *'Hydrate the focuspoint extension image size cache'* dev task after installing. It [may take a while](https://github.com/jonom/silverstripe-focuspoint/pull/91#issuecomment-799409128) if you have many images, so you may want to do it during a quiet time for your site.
